    <p><strong>TEST 01</strong></p>

    <p>You found the gate. That was the first test.</p>

    <p>
      He was the first.<br><br>
      A mind that saw patterns where others saw noise.<br>
      A man who broke the silence â€” and paid for it.<br>
      You call him Turing. We call him the Light.
    </p>

    <p>
      His trial was isolation.<br>
      Yours will be understanding.
    </p>

    <p>What he left behind is buried here.</p>

    <p>Decode what remains.</p>

    <p>When you have decrypted the transmission:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; padding-left: 1rem;">
      <li>Locate the embedded comms address.</li>
      <li>Send the code word to initiate the second gate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">No help. No retries. No Turing back.</p>
